1,"next time it will be jet2. not a great experience. i could not check in online as two separate parts of the ba computer system do not talk to each other. at lhr a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! we boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. by the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. the flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying ba meant something special. next time it will be jet2.",0.8749,Positive
2,"become the ryanair of long-haul travel. i was excited to fly ba as i'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. i've travelled to australia on many occasions, so i've pretty much travelled with them all. terrible was my experience. ba have become the ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. we were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. the charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). the in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. the food was atrocious - we flew ba lhr-hongkong and return and cathay hk-australia return and the comparison was vast. we were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with cathay. our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in hong kong and when we arrived into london, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. the only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids.",0.477,Neutral
3,"they never help us. i just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! it really looks like british airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. last week we called british airways to make a reservation for the family. at the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from american express. the representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact american express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. the conversation was recorded by british airways and could be checked. we immediately called amex (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500k miles. amex clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. we said that it was fine since we had checked previously with british airways. we then called british airways immediately to make our reservation to miami. they confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to miami) and that we could not use the miles. we explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. we called the german office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called uk customer service which was just as unhelpful. no manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). in the end british airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to miami. with this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, i have 2 days of waiting and talking with british airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. we were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as i was too long on the phone and she had other customers? and we are not customers? they never help us.",-0.8838,Negative
4,"uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. paid for business class travelling cairo to london heathrow but all i got was an economy seat. only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. ba's account on x is hacked. got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to ba nothing done about it. just disgusting. avoid.",-0.9722,Negative
5,zero customer service. the plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. i had to wipe down all the seats. after we landed i immediately realized i left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. they would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so i went to the british airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. i have complained to british airways and all i get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with lost property. zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.,-0.9079,Negative
6,"baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours. overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. they raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. poor communication and no customer facing skills.",-0.875,Negative
7,"overall very satisfied. overall very satisfied. ground staff member at yvr was extremely helpful & courteous. a350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at lhr we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at lhr which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck.",0.8721,Positive
8,"airline is a total disgrace. as always when i fly ba it was a total shambles. i was booked manchester - london - madrid , ba first leg and iberia 2nd, i try wherever possible to avoid ba, however the manchester - london was late, however i ran for my ib flight and got to b gates just as boarding started, being group 1 i went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, ba had removed me from the ib flight to a ba flight 3 hours later! as ba had reissued the ticket ib could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of ba’s total incompetence. this airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical ba crew oh im so fabulous i don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!",-0.9185,Negative
9,we were pleased with the service. first time using ba business class but we were pleased with the service received. no one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. we used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. departed early and arrived at jfk early as well. the only thing that i disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.,0.8884,Positive
10,"gate agent was extremely rude. extremely rude ground service. we were non-rev flying and london was our connection/layover. gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” however, when i put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. the plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. the gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. the flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. no complains there. just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. i understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly i would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention.",-0.5957,Negative
11,"incredibly heartless and incompetent company. my son and i flew to geneva last sunday for a skiing holiday in les arc. the flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. they didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. problems happen, it's a complex operation. what is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. the offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. the web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. there is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. we've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. the outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. what an incredibly heartless and incompetent company.",-0.8462,Negative
12,"their service was hit-and-miss. for the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). fast track through security was not honoured. the lounge at istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. eg. some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. however, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu).",0.7708,Positive
13," worse than a low-cost carrier. flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). the flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. nothing at all available to even buy to eat! worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. one of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). i would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin.",-0.9656,Negative
14,"very poor business class product. very poor business class product, ba is not even close to the other airline leaders. which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. the cabin feels and is very cramped. the food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! however, the price of course is at premier levels. the only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. i felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. would i fly ba business again? only if their were no other options and i had no choice.",-0.7082,Negative
15,"if gf - take your own food. this review is for lhr-syd-lhr. ba015 and ba016. business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. good quality pillow and duvet. privacy with sliding door. good storage space around the seat and charging point. flights on time - no delays. gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. warm processed meat between two bland slices of gf bread apparently is a business class breakfast. on two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. one crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. do ba also serve the same gf offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? my advice if gf - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of ba for 24 hours. my travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered.",0.9044,Positive
19,"incompetence in customer service. i recently encountered a highly disappointing experience with british airways, specifically regarding their customer service. after my initial flight leg was canceled, i was rebooked with a connection at london heathrow reduced to a mere 1 hour and 30 minutes. realizing the impracticality of this, i promptly contacted british airways within 10 minutes to request a more reasonable layover of 3-4 hours. shockingly, the customer support representative flatly refused, citing an inability to change my flight. despite explaining the logistical challenges of a short layover and a terminal change requiring additional security procedures, i received no assistance. to add to the frustration, the representative inaccurately noted on my account that i was presented with multiple options during our conversation. moreover, the use of military time format and the lack of initial options provided only exacerbated the communication issues. both phone and email support proved equally incompetent, and i was informed that customer service is outsourced to india, allegedly contributing to the subpar service. this experience has left me not only struggling to rebook my flight but also with a strong resolve to avoid british airways in the future. the lack of assistance, blame-shifting, and overall incompetence in customer service make it my worst experience yet. i strongly advise others to steer clear of british airways and their appalling customer service.",-0.8855,Negative
22,"does ba pay experts to design these breakfasts. all 4 of our flights were fine in terms of comfort, punctuality and service. i feel safe with ba and that is my main reason for booking with them even though i could travel with other airlines more directly. on our return flight atl/lhr we skipped the evening meal preferring to sleep and were looking forward to a hearty breakfast prior to arrival at lhr. sadly we were seriously disappointed. to serve a chicken sausage in a wrap for a business class breakfast is just unacceptable. does ba actually pay experts to design these breakfasts? low point on an otherwise good trip.",-0.4588,Neutral
23,"business class seats were abysmal. i had hoped this would be a good review but unfortunately it won’t be. i flew business class from lhr to pdx on the ba nonstop. it was a 787–8 series aircraft. the flight attendant specifically mentioned it was eight years old as he recalled flying it when it was brand new. the business class seats were abysmal. my seat was at the window facing backwards. with the divider down, which had to be in that position for boarding, taxi, takeoff and landing, i was literally just a few feet away from the person in the aisle seat who was facing forward, we both couldn’t help but stare at one another. it couldn’t be avoided. it was horrible. the service wasn’t all that good either. the flight attendant did a pre-dinner drink. when she came back to ask for my choice for dinner, she said none of my selection were left. i was a little upset as nothing else appealed to me. she then came back later, and said the other part of the aircraft had more of the meal selection i wanted. i’m not sure why they didn’t coordinate that to begin with. i was not offered any wine or other drink with with dinner. the meal was put down in front of me and the flight attendant never came back other than to clear the tray. overall, this flight was not very good. i flew over on american and back on ba and paid $6000 round-trip. i’d fly american again. my preferred carrier is united or lufthansa. i’ll never fly ba again.",-0.369,Neutral
24,"worst service/airline ever. i was going to fly to frankfurt from glasgow over london but the flight from london to frankfurt was cancelled. this meant i had to stay overnight in london where i have no accommodation etc. as i was rebooked to a flight from london city airport which was more than 2h by train i had to get an uber and then take a hotel for £250 in total (london prices). i was reassured over the phone that i would get all the money back. my flight from london city airport was then cancelled again and rebooked to london heathrow but two days later. i then cancelled that flight and rebooked a new one with lufthansa as i urgently had to get to work and needed the money. i never received the money back for the hotel, compensation for cancelled flight 1, compensation for cancelled flight 2, the extra food i had to pay for, the uber, or the actual cost of the flight. i was first transferred 3€ by british airways. they stopped replying to me and told me the issue was ""weather conditions"" although other non-ba flights were going. i lost over £700 in total and never got compensated for the loss of a work day either. it just really feels like they don't care about people. worst service/airline ever.",-0.9751,Negative
25,"much better experience this time around. much better experience this time around. flew cpt to lhr on a new a350. checkin was efficient. i used the bidvest lounge at cpt as it is better than ba's lounge. boarding was speedy. the new business class club suites are very good. slightly irritating to be directed to the wrong seat (1a instead of 1k) which meant that after settling in the passenger in 1a showed up. we arranged a seat switch. second time in a row it has happened. why can't ba staff memorise which side of the plane is which and get it right? captain's announcement was short and on point. welcome drink was served at the correct temperature i.e. cold (first time ever for me - previously ba has always served the welcome champagne warm). ife system was good - everything worked as it should. felt slightly cheap that business class passengers have to pay for wifi. i did not bother. cocktail was good. the nuts came on a cheap plastic tray which was naff ... other airlines bring out something classier. a female flight attendant came to take my order and i asked for rooibas panacotta and the chicken breast. she repeated back to me ""so you want a p and a c"". it was such a bizarre thing to say that i misheard. i thought she said ""so you want beef and sea""? confusion reigned until she explained to me she had a checklist of passenger orders and they abbreviate to first letters so she was saying ""p"" for panacotta and ""c"" for chicken. but how bizarre to repeat back an order to a passenger in code. why not just say, ""so to confirm panacotta to start and chicken as your main dish"", like every other restaurant / airline does in the world? the internal coding of food ordering is exactly that - internal. she even looked irritated at me that i did not understand her jargon first time. the food, when it came, was excellent. much much better than recent flights. i read somewhere that ba changed caterer. if so, it shows. the panacotta was superb as was the chicken ... good restaurant quality. the wine was ok to good but definitely not good to excellent. i feel that while the food has got better in ba business class, the wines have got worse. certainly compared to air france which i have also flown recently. the wine was brought out on time (not afer i finished eating as it was lass time i flew ba business). cheese was also good and not teeth crackingly cold as last time. i had a good night's sleep. plenty of snacks out if you wanted them (and they did not run out). breakfast was excellent and the coffee was hot (previously it has been lukewarm). so all in all a vastly improved service offering. the staff seemed rushed off their feet ... it would not hurt to have an extra flight attendant to look after so many business class seats. overall summary: vastly improved passenger proposition. it would be 10/10 but i deduct a point for showing me to the wrong seat and another point for the bizarre interaction with the female flight attendant who repeated my food order back to me using internal jargon codes.",0.9944,Positive
26,"our compensation rights. once again a terrible business class experience with ba. the flight was delayed by 4.5 hours, the plane was very old with problems with at least 4 of the seats in business class not cleaned properly prior to departure. food was terrible as always with ba and only one choice available from advertised menu. as a result of the delay we missed our connecting flight from heathrow and instead of putting us on the next connection they chose the second last flight of the day - which was also delayed by over an hour meaning we had an additional 4 hour delay whilst at heathrow. at no point were we advised about our compensation rights (despite asking at check in and connections) or provided any vouchers during the delays. having flown etihad, qatar and virgin business class equivalents over the last year it is clear to see how big the gulf now is between ba and its rivals.",-0.9465,Negative
27,"a380's are showing their age. ba a380's are showing their age, hopefully they will update the interiors soon because it was a let down especially when the flight lasts 11 hours. cabin crew were good and helpful. dinner was ok but the breakfast was grim. on board entertainment was not the latest and seat back usb points didn't work. the only upside of ba is that it is only 1 of 2 airlines who fly this route directly and their pricing reflects this, if you're prepared to lay over then there are better airlines out there.",0.8047,Positive
28,"service was fantastic. credit to ba - flew to singapore recently and also back from doha to london and both experiences were great. service was fantastic as was the quality of the food, entertainment and was left feeling ba have got it together after a few previous below average experiences. you definitely notice the difference with the staff on ba - far more approachable and outgoing compared to the cold and corporate middle eastern airline crews. nice one ba for 2 great flights.",0.9768,Positive
29,"it was a very nice flight. the check in area for premium classes at gatwick is very nice, and there was no queue when i arrived so i was able to drop my bag very quickly. premium security at gatwick is fine. the flight was delayed due to nats issues, but the member of staff on arriving at the lounge let me know of this. the lounge is nicevand it’ very comfortable. there was an excellent range of food and drinks. all the drinks you would expect. food wise there were sandwiches, soup, pasta, salads, fruit, spanish stew, as well as turkey and ham pies with mashed potato, roasted parsnips and carrots and gravy. it was all really good and particularly nice to see so many options. boarding was pretty slow, although the gate crew did a good job to keep it well organised and allow priority passengers to board first. as has been well documented the onboard experience in terms of seat on ba europe business is pretty poor, but in line with other european carriers sadly. that being said, the seat is well padded and comfortable and the adjustable headrest is quite good. the on board catering was of excellent quality. i was lucky to get my preferred option of the roast turkey, but several people sat near me weren’t as lucky. i do understand that meal options may run out but when the meal options are roast turkey with all the trimmings, vegetarian cottage pie or a chicken salad you really should be stocking enough for every passenger to get the proper meal  or failing that, allow an order in advance service where you then only stock the meals that people want to eat. whilst i fully support the desire to minimise waste, both food and cost, people really should really be able to get the ideal meal option. unfortunately one of the people affected reacted very badly to this and took it out on the cabin crew which is unacceptable.. they also lost a bit of perspective about just how serious a situation it actually was! the cabin crew were  very nice, friendly and professional, if a little slow.. but not to the point of detracting from the positive experience i had. the ground service at gran canaria was pretty poor, priority bags clearly meant nothing. 95% of bags coming out were not priority, mine came out about halfway through bag delivery and demonstrates poor delivery of service and not  fulfilling on the service they promise to their customers. overall though it was a very nice flight, and having paid for it using avios and £1 i cannot complain at all.",0.9977,Positive
30,onboard service was efficient. the flight took off a little late due to heathrow congestion but still landed on schedule. boarding was smooth and the onboard service was efficient. a small snack was served for free with a bottle of water; additional items were available for purchase. the cabin and toilets were very clean. overall an unremarkable flight but in a good way!,0.9537,Positive
31,"lots of stress. ba is great in the air! but... they sell you connections thru london heathrow terminal 5 (their private, ba-only terminal) which you are practically not able to make. 90 minutes stopover time, european flight inbound, transatlantic flight outbound, you arrive at the terminal gate on time and... book, security! endless line, slow process. your boarding starts and you are nowhere near the x ray, and then.... it is a train ride withing the same terminal (but different, distant buildings). almost impossible to make. lots of stress.",0.3682,Neutral
32,"did not offer a wheelchair. i had broken my leg 2 days before our return flight from lisbon to london. i called to get some assistance from british airways, hoping for wheelchair assistance, an easier seat to get to, or possibly an upgrade so that i could stretch out my broken leg, which was in a cast. this airline failed on all fronts. quoted us a price of €6,000 each (i was traveling with my husband), which we could not do. almost didn't let me on the plane, trying to interpret my medical report. they did not attempt to change our seats, which were near the back. the single concession they made was to allow me to board 1st, but did not offer a wheelchair, so i had to swing myself down the aisle to my seat using the arm rests of all 21 rows before my seat, as the aisles are not wide enough for crutches. might i add, i am nearly 70. had to exit same way. no wheelchair waiting for me at heathrow, had to hop onto bus with crutches to change terminals and nearly took a tumble doing so. took so long to get a wheelchair that they had to hold my connecting flight (on another airline) for me and we were last to board. that flight had allowed us to upgrade to business class, for a reasonable price, and took great care of me.",0.7992,Positive

34,"such a terrible customer experience. never i saw such a terrible customer experience. the plane landed already 30 minutes late: despite any operational delays, the boarding took over 1 hour because the crew did not know where to place the luggages. after this long 1 hour boarding process, the captain did not apologise.  this is extremely frustrating when this occurs on a night flight, forcing passengers to lose train connections to home.",-0.88,Negative
35,"i was pleasantly surprised. having not flown with ba for a few years, i read some of the reviews in preparation, needless to say i boarded this flight with low expectations. i was pleasantly surprised as the flight was ok. we left lhr a few minutes early and arrived at jnb ahead of schedule. cabin crew, although not as good as some carriers were attentive and professional. onboard catering was a disappointment as if you were unlucky to miss out on the chicken you were given a very sloppy pasta. on board entertainment has never been ba's strong point and sadly that hasn't changed. unfortunately ba is not the prestigious carrier it once was but its not as bad (from my experience) as some reviews suggest.",0.3047,Neutral
36,"buckle up, folks; this one's a rollercoaster. dear community i feel compelled to share the utter frustration and disappointment that defined my recent travel experience with british airways. buckle up, folks; this one's a rollercoaster. on july 16 and 17, 2023, i had the displeasure of flying with british airways on ba709 and ba7, and let me tell you, it was a nightmare. the initial flight from zurich (zrh) to london (lhr) on ba709 faced a seemingly unavoidable one-hour delay upon arrival at lhr. this, of course, resulted in me missing my connection to tokyo, triggering an automatic rescheduling of my flight to tokyo (hnd) via beijing with air china. oh, but the fun didn't stop there — flight ca183 was also delayed, turning my 16-hour delay into a grand total of 23 hours, finally arriving in tokyo at 23:00 instead of the promised 7:10. and the cherry on top? my four checked-in suitcases decided to take a detour and didn't join me in tokyo, forcing me to waste an additional two hours filling out forms at the baggage center. i finally got my lost luggage back on july 23, because why make it easy, right? but wait, there's more! my return flight from tokyo to zurich (ba8) on august 8 also danced to the delay tune, making me question if punctuality is just a myth for british airways. the cumulative impact of these delays torpedoed my vacation plans, stealing a whole day of scheduled activities, including a guided tokyo tour. as if that weren't enough, i had to dig deeper into my pockets for unforeseen expenses—extra airport transfers, tour operator assistance fees, emergency purchases, airport meals, and international calls for rearrangements. the lack of assistance at lhr airport was the icing on this bitter cake. installing the ba app just to get basic information about alternative connection flights was a hassle, and the fact that no ba clerk could provide this info in person was downright infuriating. british airways, you've left me with a sour taste in my mouth and a dent in my wallet. here's hoping you take this feedback seriously and step up your game because right now, it's not a good look. frustrated and fed up, bert",-0.9849,Negative

38,"service level far worse then ryanair. 4 hours before takeoff we received a mail stating a cryptic message that there are disruptions to be expected as there is a limit on how many planes can leave at the same time. so did the capacity of the heathrow airport really hit british airways by surprise, 4h before departure? anyhow - we took the one hour delay so what - but then we have been forced to check in our hand luggage. i travel only with hand luggage to avoid waiting for the ultra slow processing of the checked in luggage. overall 2h later at home than planed, with really no reason, just due to incompetent people. service level far worse then ryanair and triple the price. really never again. thanks for nothing.",-0.9342,Negative

127,"they have really gone downhill. terrible experience with british airways. i booked a flight with ba to travel from gibraltar to london heathrow on may 10, 2023. my flight was scheduled to leave at 4:00 p.m. in the afternoon. i had originally planned on leaving my luggage at heathrow upon arrival and travelling to visit and overnight at my cousin's place. en route to gib airport a few hours prior to departure, i checked my flight details and found out that my flight had been cancelled. i had a connecting flight booked with westjet from london heathrow to vancouver the following day and i had to make that flight, so it was imperative that i got to london. i checked the ba website and couldn't find any other flights with them that would work, so unfortunately i made the mistake of requesting a refund. i managed to find a flight out of malaga that got me into london just after 10:00 p.m. so i booked that and then called british airways as i wanted to discuss compensation. that's when they advised me that because i had requested a refund (they used the phrase ""abandoned"" travel with them), they were not prepared to do anything for me. apparently, i should have called them first, and then they would have made the arrangements. of course they don't explain that on their website - they just ask if you want a refund and then proceed. and even when i plead my case with the agent at malaga airport and then followed up with customer relations several times via email, they flat out refused to budge. i had used a travel voucher to cover the cost of my flight and had used avios to cover the cost of my checked baggage, so in other words no out of pocket costs for the trip. once this incident happened, i ended up spending 660 euros in airfare and checked baggage charges to get to london from malaga (i.e., different airport than the one i had originally booked from). and because the luggage storage facility at heathrow had closed by the time i eventually arrived, i ended up booking a night at a hotel since i couldn't travel by train to my cousin's place any longer (3 bags in tow) and i didn't want to put him out and have him drive to the airport to pick me up. this cost me another £125 in room and meal costs. all ba ended up doing to compensate me was to give me 5,000 free avios - a mere pittance compared to my out of pocket expenses. despite trying to explain to them why i requested the refund instead of calling them first, they wouldn't budge. very easy for them to say what i should have done since they work there and know the rules and they weren't the ones scrambling to find alternative travel arrangements within a few hours. i pointed out that on their website they should simply instruct customers to call them when this situation happens, and that way they would never encounter this problem. my feeling is that they put the refund option out there in the hope that customers will make the mistake i did so they can then wash their hands of the situation and ultimately save money. i've been an executive club member for years and they simply didn't care. they said there was nothing they could do. i'm sure if one of the ba executive's friends or family members had gone through this, staff there would have been given the instruction to make things right. i used to be a fan of ba but they have really gone downhill in my opinion. once i used up my remaining avios and travel credit, i will cancel my executive club membership and never fly with them again.",-0.4836,Neutral

198,"most appalling airline service. i will never travel with british airways again. i spent over $10,000 on a business class seat to attend a funeral in the uk. first, the boeing 787-9 cabin has 7 seats across the aisle so what you are getting in reality is premium economy. the seats are narrow and effectively are a business class seat cut in half. they have squeezed these seats in which means that some passengers bump their heads into the bulkhead when they stand up and many have to clamber over others to go to the toilet, which wakes up that passenger. the whole point about business class is that you pay to rest and have privacy and not have someone push over the top of you. second, the food was disgusting. third, the service terrible. fourth, the toilet was tiny. fifth, the inflight screen was fixed and too high so i could not see anything. sixth, their baggage handling is also appalling meaning that my taxi was waiting for 2 hours and i had to pay more (no free airport transfers with british airways). seventh, the charging points did not work. the second leg to london was on a larger plane with 4 seats across the aisle. that was bearable because no hopping over people but the seat was very uncomfortable because it was not one piece. this means that you are sleeping on a metal bar (the seat) where there is a gap in the seat. to add insult to injury i now find that both flights back to sydney are on the small plane. to book a seat before check in is $170. i paid it but note that there were only 4 seats left. this is why i got the worst seat in the house going out. this is the most appalling airline service i have ever encountered. there is no point paying for business class in british airways.",-0.981,Negative

246,"a horror show of incompetence. the usual shambolic unfolding that ba has now unfortunately been come to known for. we had a long weekend flight booked to munich that was supposed to be departing on 9th february at 19:55. this happened to be our first flight with our newborn (3 month old) daughter. it turned out to be a horror show of incompetence. just under 3hrs before scheduled departure, the original 9th february flight was cancelled. we received an email as we were boarding the heathrow express. i’d booked a day of holiday off work for this trip. we ended up getting doing a round trip to paddington instead. on the way back from the cancelled flight, both me and my wife tried calling ba. despite one of us having silver membership (possibly the largest joke of a membership currently out there), i took us nearly 45 minutes to speak to someone who could help. i believe ba outsource their call centres and so you end up talking to people who are following a script. the result is that you might as well be speaking to an ai rather than a human. we often received the response similar to ‘computer says no’. if this is the service level for silver members i can’t imagine what a regular punter has to put up with. when the phone originally connected to a person, i had to wait 5 minutes as his computer booted up. - ba then proceeded to auto-book us onto a new flight for the next day but going to a different destination. our original flight was to munich and the auto-booked replacement flight was to salzburg. when asking the robot at the ba call centre why they booked us on a replacement flight to a location 135km apart, they couldn’t understand my frustration.  eventually, someone was able to book us onto a flight the following day at 17:00. not ideal as i’d wasted a valuable day off work and the hotel wouldn’t refund us or move our booking, but at least we were going to munich and not salzburg. - the day of the new flight came round and, this time, we managed to get all the way to the check in desk. upon arriving at the check in desk, we were told that our rebooked flight had just been cancelled 4 minutes earlier. no email. no text. no notification ever arrived from ba to tell us that the flight had been cancelled. incomprehensible as to how this could have possibly happened. the check in person said i should get on the app to rebook. at this point, i didn’t know whether to explode with anger or cry. luckily, another check in person had an ounce of sympathy and explained to the useless check in person that he could actually rebook us. we were booked onto another flight later that evening (19:55 - ba0958). unfortunately, that meant 5hrs in the grotty lounge with a 3 month old baby. it appears that everyone now has access to a lounge and so there’s really no difference between the lounge and a hostel, other than you get free stuff in the former. this was not a pleasant experience. we did eventually arrive in munich and, despite asking, didn’t get our push chair/stroller delivered to the front of the plane. the plane was a characteristically ba dumping ground - they used to give you sanitising wipes so you could clean your seat and tray table down but they seemed to have cut back on this service too. all in all, another shocking ba service. a lost day of holiday and not an an ounce of empathy/sympathy/understanding at all from any of the employees i interacted with.",-0.9764,Negative

288,"the worst business class experience i've ever had. probably the worst business class experience i've ever had on an airline. just a few of the issues: required to purchase seats on international (club world) business class. this was not made known during the ticket purchase process and cost me an additional $600 on a single leg (lhr-lax) for a family of four. given the very strange business class seating layout on ba a380s, leaving the seat selection to change could have been disastrous for my family. ridiculously long boarding times on even small aircraft. on my vie-lhr leg, the boarding time for the a320 was over 50 minutes long, leading to a delayed departure. there was no urgency on the part of staff to speed up the boarding times. severe overcrowding in the boarding area in satellite c of terminal 5 at heathrow. boarding staff would not allow passengers to enter the roped off queue area before boarding (i have no idea why not) and so crowding was extreme. the overall boarding area was far too small for an a380, and i believe this satellite was designed and built after the first a380s were delivered. online check-in in advance of flights appears to be completely broken. i was urged repeatedly (on the ba website, and via email and text) to ""upload my covid documents"" even though, at the end of 2022, there are no covid documents required for travel. after i filled in basic contact information on the website - and did not upload any ""covid documentation"" - i was informed (several hours later) that my ""covid documents have been verified"". i then received another text message urging me to ""upload my covid documentation"". on the vie-lhr leg, the shop.ba.com page that one is directed to after attempting to connect to wifi on the plane indicated ridiculously incorrect remaining flight times - over six hours, and then four hours just before landing. ba lounges for club europe and club world at heathrow are often seriously overcrowded. furniture and carpeting and other finishes in the clubs are worn or dirty. that said, the food in the lounges was of pretty good quality. the food quality in ba lounges at heathrow may be the only redeeming thing about this airline. onboard, food and beverage service was far below average for international business class. terrible, one might say. on the lhr-lax leg, there was no pre-meal beverage service and there were no mid-flight beverage services at all. unlike most business class offerings on other airlines, there was no taking a meal order by flight attendants at the beginning of the flight. meals were brought out haphazardly shortly after take off, with the ""chicken or fish?"" type of meal selection similar to economy class. there was no coffee or tea service after meals. food quality was poor, with the pre-landing snack of a ""ploughman's lunch"" being downright disgusting. . there was no beverage or bar set-up in the galley areas - beverages available to passengers during the flight - as is standard on most international business class offerings. even bottles of water seemed be hidden away, requiring one to ask the flight attendants for water. i won't comment on the bizarre seating layout on the a380, as others have rightly panned the awkwardness and extremely poor design of the seating. the seats are not 6' 2"" long as stated on the ba website, and i found the seats too short for my 6' 2"" height. the ""priority"" luggage tags were not followed in the baggage delivery.",-0.9944,Negative

330,"no attempt to provide fresh or hot foo. just a few years ago flying on ba was enjoyable, but times have changed. these days about five hours on board the plane is no fun at all. the terminal 5 experience still feels classy, and on the way out it felt well staffed and efficient. on board though, it’s just become an experience to be endured. ba’s mean decision to split seats into nicer for the first half of the plane, and nastier for the rest underlines this. there is no entertainment, no magazine. refreshment purchases are brought to the seat after ordering from an app. there is no attempt to provide fresh or hot food on the day, despite the competition being able to do this. is it too much to ask for, when trapped on board for five hours? you get a free tiny bottle of water and a small cereal bar. on the outbound flight the crew collected rubbish just once before landing, but helpfully tied a bag around a toilet door down the back in case anyone wanted to fight their way past and clear things up themselves. recline buttons have been deleted on the seats and the seat pitch feels squeezed. on the return flight, for one reason or another due to ba’s delays from the previous day, we were just under two hours late getting off the plane late in the evening and some passengers couldn’t travel at all because there were not enough crew. the cabin crew were nonetheless distinctly more professional on this flight. altogether, i would say good things if there were any - but it’s hard to think of anything i could recommend ba for; and that is a pity, because it used to be a professional company to deal with and a pleasure worth looking forward to when making european journeys.",0.9715,Positive

459,"you can and need to do better than this. very poor flight from cape town to london. after the chaos of cape town airport passenger handling with incredibly long queues to get through security and then passport control taking nearly two hours in total we arrived at the lounge somewhat frazzled and were very happy to find a quiet area with decent wine and appropriate food choices for a break before boarding the flight. boarding went well and we were seated and offered a small half full glass of champagne. the captain made an announcement to say that we were all aboard ahead of schedule and that the flight time would be shorter than scheduled but unfortunately this would mean our arrival would be too early to land due to the 6.00 am lifting of the overnight jet ban at heathrow so we would have to wait on the ground for perhaps half an hour or so. this was no big deal. then the captain announced that due to it issues at heathrow they could get not compile necessary paperwork so we would be delayed for an indefinite period. with the delay of uncertain duration one might have hoped for a further offering of champagne or other beverage in particularly for business class but this was not forthcoming. in the event take off was permitted quite soon after. the crew had distributed menus but then did a pa to say that there were changes to each of the main courses. a drinks order was taken for pre dinner drinks, for main course for dinner and choice of wine with dinner. drinks and nuts were served circa 45 minutes after take off, in my case a small measure of white wine in the bottom of a pleasant and decent sized tumbler and my husband had another half glass of champagne. dinner arrived on a single tray with a small measure of red wine in the tumbler. the food looked bland, unappetising and tasted the more so. the cheese (two small pieces) were sitting in a greasy pool of vinegary chutney. no top up of the wine was offered (we did ask for a second glass and it was provided on a very individualised basis) and coffee was not served since we had hit some mild turbulence. the flight was some 11 hours in duration and no other snacks or beverages were offered prior to breakfast which was provided separately to each passenger as they showed signs of being awake. breakfast was slightly more edible than dinner. coffee or tea were offered by individual mug, orange juice was available on request. cabin crew were largely absent from the cabin except during the meal services but it must be said that they were extremely pleasant and were suitably responsive to requests for individual items. come on british airways you can and need to do better than this if you are to meet customer expectations and compete with other airlines on similar routes. for the cost of a business class ticket passengers are enjoying only additional space and seat comfort (flatbed) as a benefit over an economy ticket at or below 25% of the price paid for the premium cabin. time was when flying in business class was real treat, no longer is this the case.",0.9464,Positive

492,"performance of the flight deck was up to its usual high standard. boarding was slow and uncomfortable on account of the lack air-con at the gate. the club suite cabins were about 3/4 full, but the rest of the plane can't have been much more than 20% occupancy. whether this is the reason why cabin crew on the flight were cut to the bare minimum is hard to say, but they certainly had to work hard covering multiple cabins. despite that, the drink and food service in business was efficient, and the current policy of serving all courses at once meant that dinner was done and dusted two hours after take-off, which is a real bonus on a night-time flight. however, the quality of the food remains mediocre at best and the pasta dish was almost inedible. the club suite is a big improvement on the ancient cw product, although storage is a funny arrangement of tiny compartments that invite losing a smartphone or two. one definitely misses the drawer at foot level in old cw. the large screen really improves the viewing experience and the whole ife system was much more responsive. the new seats don't significantly aid sleeping, particularly as there's an obvious ridge at the level of the base of the spine. waking up two hours before touchdown is definitely to be recommended in order to get breakfast over and to avoid the usual queues for the toilets. performance of the flight deck was up to its usual high standard and arrival was twenty minutes ahead of schedule. progress through border control was speedy but baggage collection was delayed for unspecified reasons. overall, a good flight.",0.9895,Positive

495,i said i wanted 20-25% back off my holiday. over the past 2 years i have flown with british airways twice and ended up in the exact same predicament of having to wait around all day in london heathrow for a 1 hour flight home to newcastle. while the holidays and the plane staff are fantastic the customer service and the staff at heathrow are useless. first time in february 2020 i got stuck in heathrow due to storm ciara when travelling home from work which was not the airlines fault. however the handling of the situation by the staff at the airport was a joke. they had 4 to 5 staff ran a kiosk queue of over 100+ unhappy travellers whilst they could have set up mini kiosks on the unused gates to get through everyone quicker. their was no crowd control and at one point after queuing for 2 hours plus the staff decided to shut up shop. in the end after a 12 hour battle i was lucky enough to get home on the last flight of the day through sheer luck when i finally spoke to someone. in november 2021 i decided to give ba a second chance and booked to go to new york. since the plane landed late into lhr i missed my connecting flight which could have been avoided if the staff at heathrow had assisted me or held the plane for a short while. as i rushed through customs i did manage to make it to the gate with 5 minutes to spare and the plane still in the terminal but since they had taken my luggage off the flight they told me to go to the service desk and refused to let me on since they had moved me on to a later flight. my layover was now 10 hours and all i got from the guest services was a £12 food voucher to spend and a phone number for what i thought was complaints but after being on hold for 20 minutes found out it was not from complaints. considering the fact this could have all been avoidable with more assistance to have only been given a food voucher for £12 seemed really cheap. a few days after i got home i then raised a complaint expressing how annoyed i was and waited over a month for a response before chasing it up only to find the complaints staff were not working. when i got a response i said i wanted 20-25% back off my holiday. i got an apology and told the staff at heathrow will be better but in terms of good will and compensation i was offered nothing!,0.2042,Neutral
496,"return trip was disappointing. return trip cape town to durban in club class highlighted the inconsistency. our outbound trip in december was good in all respects, whereas the return trip was disappointing. check in was fine, apart from the agent failing to label one of bags priority, resulting in a long wait for our third bag. the lounge was busy, but no complaints. we went to the boarding gate at the check in time indicated on the screen, where there was no sign of activity, although the screen was still showing the same gate and departure time. shortly thereafter two ground staff appeared and when approached said the flight was delayed from 1330 to 1410 and the gate was changed to the lower level bus gates. the informational screens had now updated to the delayed time and new gate. i checked on the flight radar app, which showed that our aircraft had started in durban, and flown to cape town, port elizabeth, back to cape town, and it had been clear for some time that it had no hope of being on time for our flight. in fact looking at its schedule and turn around times it was always going to be late. boarding eventually started at 1400 with departure at 1430, 60 minutes late. drinks service only started 30 minutes later, followed by lunch. the food was good but the wine offering very mediocre, and not up to club standards. with the price of good wines in south africa there is no excuse for serving poor wine. lunch service was quick, but then the crew disappeared behind the curtain and there was no offering of top up drinks unless specifically requested. overall this was a disappointing flight with a lacklustre crew",-0.8861,Negative

498,"complete disregard for your passengers. i recently had the unfortunate privilege of travelling on british airways from detroit to bangalore and back. given that it is a long and arduous journey with multiple layovers, i decided to spend extra and get a business class ticket. i was quickly dissuaded of any misconception that i was special because i spent that extra money or was in business class. from shoddy service to rudeness and insolence from ground staff, i experienced nothing but frustration and insecurity throughout my journeys. the trump was being stranded in london having missed my connection and spending close to 3 hours to get to the front of the counter to rebook my flight. being a business class traveller had no bearing as we were all told to stand in one gigantic line and wait our turn. some special passengers were escorted to the club world check in. when we asked the lady, she told us to continue standing where we were and she would come back to get us when the counter freed up. needless to say it never did. finally got my turn with no extra help from any of the ground staff that was running around in a frenzy and was rebooked. so i come back to the question: can big corporations lie with no accountability? why would i spend my hard-earned money on something that gave me nothing extra? shame on you british airways for your complete disregard for your passengers. stop your lying or update your promises!",-0.925,Negative

672,"still consider other airlines. toronto to geneva via london. i stopped flying ba about three years ago after they dramatically downgraded their service. apparently things have improved somewhat since, so i decided to give them another try. overall, i was happy with my experience, save for two major gripes. on the plus side: i flew on new aircraft, which were comfortable, albeit with the usual narrow seats for modern aircraft (same with all airlines). legroom on the 787-9 was generous and seemed to be more than the official 31"". pilots were very good and informative, as always with ba. quality of food on long-haul has definitely improved since the bad old days of soggy pasta and droopy sandwiches; i rather enjoyed the meals served, which were on nice large trays. the ife was just about adequate, though surprisingly dated for such new aircraft. cathay pacific's is far superior. the two major downsides: 1. the new basic economy fare. it is really pesky and serves only to disgruntle passengers. ba really need to get rid of it. virtually everyone on long-haul has to check in a bag, so please just include it in all airfare types. if i wanted to be nickle-and-dimed, i'd fly to gatwick on a charter airline. also, not being able to choose a seat even at the time of check-in is infuriating. i was automatically allocated a middle seat even though the entire rear half of the plane was empty! this just goes to show that you will get a middle seat unless you pay. thankfully, the lady at check-in changed it to a window seat free of charge after i asked nicely. 2. no complimentary catering on short-haul. seeing as virtually all passengers flying to/from heathrow are connecting to/from long-haul flights with ba and have spent at least $1,000 on their airfare, i resented a drink and snack not being included on the short-haul segment of my trip. ba should not be treating connecting passengers the same as those on low-cost airlines who only paid a few dollars for a short trip. if ba would get rid of these two new features, i would not hesitate to fly with them again, as everything else about my trip was pleasant. as it is, i would still consider other airlines.",0.9886,Positive

796,"the value was very good. having booked this flight a week before the ba strike and mistakingly thinking that the strike would have ended two days before i flew and not in fact the day before, i was apprehensive as to how it would operate. the check-in and security clearance at t5 took only 15 minutes. personally i do not like the self service bag and tag drop that ba operate as one is not 100% confident that i did everything correctly. boarding is by the new fare group system (1 to 5) which depends on how much one has paid for the ticket. again i'm not a fan of this. possibly due to the previous day's strike and the need to accommodate passengers from canceled flights, the aircraft was a large a321. boarding was however smooth. on board the virtually full cabin was very clean and the eurotraveller seats were comfortable and offer sufficient leg room (i'm 1m.79cm and my knees do not touch the seat in front). the departure was only 15 minutes behind the scheduled departure time. in flight there were 3 cabin staff in the euro traveller cabin (believe 2 in club cabin) who were very efficient and friendly and so one only had to wait no more than 30 minutes from take off to purchase refreshments on such a full flight. again it is a shame though that ba have gone down the no frills line and charge for food and drinks when they describe themselves as a full service airline. the landing at tegel was 30 minutes ahead of schedule. all in all it was a pleasant flight and the value was very good as it was combined with a hotel booking. tegel itself is a bit of hassle with only 2 border police carrying out immigration controls for over 200 passengers at the end of the airbridge and a further 30 minute wait for luggage but this was not ba's fault.",0.7621,Positive

802,"don’t know which airline is at fault. london to dublin. it was never my choice to fly with british airways and i will never fly with them again. i was supposed to fly with american airlines from the usa to dublin, but i had a connecting flight from my origin city to chicago. unfortunately, my first flight was delayed due to weather, which caused me to miss the flight from chicago to dublin. i was put on a flight to london instead, which i had to run for when i finally made it to chicago, and my bag did not make it on the flight. i then flew with british airways from london to dublin. i was told to file a lost baggage claim with ba, which i did. i was told that the bag would be transferred from american to ba when it arrived in dublin. using american’s baggage tracking system, i was able to confirm that the bag arrived the day after i did around noon on saturday. i am writing this review on the following sunday and the bag is still not in my possession. ba’s customer service is terrible. if someone there tells me one more time to just wait and be patient, i am going to lose it! my bag has been sitting at the airport in the same city i’m in for more than a day and i can’t get it. talk about serious frustration. i don’t know which airline is at fault for the delay, but the difference is that when i called american, the rep did everything she could to find out the status of my bag. and even though their baggage claim desk was closed when i called, she still tried to call an internal number to see if anyone was still around. unfortunately she couldn’t get hold of anyone, but she left them a message and told me exactly who i could call and when to call them the next morning. i did not receive that level of service from ba. i even asked if they could call the airport and was told, “we are not authorized to call airports.” why in the world wouldn’t they be authorized to call their own baggage department? i am not thrilled with either airline, but at least american has made some attempt to help me. this has ruined the first three days of a trip that i planned for two years. if you do check a bag and it’s lost or delayed, don’t expect any help if you flew with ba. and here’s a tip: if you are dealing with a lost or delayed bag in a country you don’t live in, don’t call the generic customer service number on the website you would normally use. dig around and see if you can find a number for the airport you flew into. you will get a lot more information and assistance that way.",-0.9905,Negative

859,"flight has improved my opinion on british airways. johannesburg to cape town return. this flight was operated by comair, and thus it was quite different from a normal british airways flight in europe. check in at the priority line was uneventful, however on the return the guy at the counter did not know that oneworld sapphire could check in at the business class counter and kept on asking if i was flying business. johannesburg airport and cape town's domestic terminal is laid out very similarly. their lounge, called slow is actually impressive. although there was no full english on offer unlike the british airways galleries lounges in other places, there was a substantial amount of savoury snacks, pastries and small bites. they even had a coffee counter with made-to-order drinks. i assume later in the day this also becomes a bar serving alcohol. very impressive for a domestic business class lounge. priority boarding was honoured, and boarding was an orderly process. i would recommend anybody wanting to get an extra legroom seat to reserve row 6, as there is actually tons of legroom in front. i reserved an exit row and paid an extra £7 per exit row during the booking. these seats were old and plush, however i do prefer the newer leather seat used on their european aircraft as those offer better support. i had also noticed during boarding that their business class had slightly larger seats, in a 2x3 configuration. i did not expect this as business class in europe is normally just a blocked middle seat. there were several drink services on this two hour flight, and a hot breakfast with either a bacon, sausage and scrambled egg option or cheese omelette with vegetables option. needless to say, a hot meal on a two hour flight is very appreciated. it was also rather tasty and tasted quite fresh. the crew were very friendly, making casual jokes and giving a down-to-earth friendliness you rarely get on airlines these days. they were quite rushed, but understandable due to the short flight time. in cape town airport, it was actually quite weird to see them use both an airbridge and stairs for passengers to deplane/board. but since it took only 15 minutes to board a rather full 737, it works and makes sense. i think that this flight has improved my opinion on british airways, and they were the same price as the competition, south african airways. i would be very curious on my next visit to see how the two of them compare, given the fact that both are giving a near homologous product on africa's busiest air route. for the price paid, i'd be happy to fly them again.",0.9843,Positive
860,"seat comfort has been sacrificed. grenada to gatwick. having flown with ba on this aircraft type prior to refurbishment, i was intrigued to experience the changes to the cabin. the cabin was much smarter - previous aircraft have looked very tired and the lighting was pleasant. the entertainment system was hugely improved, with a good selection of media on larger touch screen devices. i suppose the reason i appreciated this was because the old systems were so hopelessly outdated! but the family really found them entertaining. for me the real issue was the tight leg room - i am a slim 6ft 2'' and now the lack of seat width made it almost impossible to eat a meal! it was for me very tight. previously the seat format was 3-3-3. it is now 3-4-3. we were sat in the 4 outbound although on return, we sat near the back of economy where the aircraft narrows and seats become 2-4-2. we sat in a 2, which was more bearable. i also found the seat really hard after a couple of hours although sitting on the supplied back rest cushion helped a bit! despite best efforts to sleep, i failed..... i remember the old seats being more comfortable, especially for long haul. service was professional and timely and food was similar to previous flights - edible. in summary, it seems a shame that ba have improved some aspects of the experience, but seat comfort has been sacrificed, which is a great pity.",0.8693,Positive

1059,"so much ba could do to improve. gatwick to barbados. we flew out of gatwick on the 6th december and back on the 17th dec. it started well in the newish 1st class lounge at the south terminal. however, the walk to the gate is miles. it has to be almost 1/2 mile walk which is a joke to be honest. the north terminal, where this flight used to operate from is not only a shorter walk for this flight, the decor and layout is much, much better. i'd guess ba got offered a cheaper deal to move to the s.t. my first impression was how badly the ""new"" 1st class is holding up. there are scuff marks everywhere. surface scratches. bobbles of wear on the seat fabric. it's probably under 5 years of use but looks more like 10. in the wc there are small cracks in the plastic walls and brown stains. needs a paint job at least. the motley flowers (that ba removed some years ago to save costs, but re-instated) are there. they looked like they had been pinched from a graveyard. much has been said about the seat being ""an up market business class"" - and this is true. it is not a true 1st class in the sense of what emirates and singapore airlines offer. (i have flown both in 1st). the food is also business class quality. more casual dining rather than fine dining. taking one meal; it starts with an amuse bouche. one motley round mozzarella bit of cheese. one tomato. one bit of green stuff. one straggly piece of prosciutto ham. total cost about 30p. outstanding! i then had prosciutto wrapped asparagus with garlic aioli and parmesan. totally, utterly boring. my wife had the soup which she said was nice. i then had jerk chicken dish. it was just about okay. the glassware and chinaware was okay. the cutlery was poor quality, the stuff you'd expect in pizza express, except the stuff in pizza express is better. i accept we are stuck with this 1st product for the next 30 years or so, but there is so much ba could do to improve the ""cheap"" look of their premium product. quality of presentation, food, champagne, even the menu covers. they trumpet the ""superb"" laurent perrier grand siecle champagne, which retails at £120 a bottle. its nice, but we all know this is inferior to what most airline 1st class offer in krug. £20 a bottle more! the alternative to 1st is of course the ghastly ying-yang club business class. the world's most hated business class in the sky. i'm a businessman and i know i could run this airline better, from a quality perspective. from a price perspective, if you bundle a 1st flight as part of a ba holiday, it sort of works out okay-ish. the fas as always were a very nice bunch of men and women.",0.9951,Positive

(apparently 3 are loaded in london for the o/w leg but none for the return.) friendly mixed fleet crew who offered good service. fast bar service followed by veggie pasta or chicken stir fry offered which was foul. salty, dry and overcooked with reheated rice and mushy vegetables. the salad is a nonsense – a few leaves and a tomato slice. pudding was sickly chocolate sponge thing which was gross. got a couple of hours sleep. however the ife froze after take off due to the pa system remaining locked on and preventing the ife from working. a reset halfway through the flight worked, though two loud renditions of delibe’s “flower duet” burst out throughout the aircraft twice waking everyone up. the standard t&cs and juice and the pretzel roll with cream cheese offered before landing. i continue to be amazed this breakfast is offered as so few people accept or eat it given how awful it is. (ba should be embarrassed that it’s even offered) after leaving toronto 5 mins late, we arrived 5 early at the gate at heathrow which was welcome along with fast bags. for the return leg, i took the seasonal lgw to toronto flight which was a couple of hundred bucks cheaper. an upgrade to club world was a pleasant surprise. fast check in at lgw but slow slow slow security – even in the fast track lane. gatwick airport sell £5 premium experience and so the lane was full of folk paying 5 quid mixed in with ba fast track customers. excellent lounge once again with a good choice of food, and champagne available as a help yourself. efficient boarding and a great reception from the gatwick cabin crew. a fast offering of champagne (with a top up) before take off though the old safety video was still showing. the gatwick crew remind me of long haul crew from heathrow – more experienced, faster and a more relaxed service than mixed fleet crew at who follow service to the letter which results in a slow and impersonal service. fast bar service once airborne, followed by the old biz food service. overcooked steak (again) alongside jerk chicken and a veggie option. plenty of wine and drinks along with t&c. after a pleasant 3 hour nap, i woke to afternoon tea which was the standard old offering minus the clotted cream – off the menu due to supply issues. at the gate early and fast bags too. this club flight was weird in that its hybrid in nature and in transition to the new biz service. so new toiletries and bedding but the old menu. i hope gatwick catches up so ba don’t (unintentionally) promote two levels of biz service with lgw being the poor relative. on the o/w leg, premium economy was in desperate need of a revamp. the food is truly awful – both dinner and breakfast, and it really wouldn’t take much to add better food, bedding and an enhanced drink service as ba really lag behind air canada on this route with premium economy. i do not regard the experience as a premium economy service other than the seat. all that said, i felt that ba is regaining it’s mojo with great crew, improved on board experience (cuts reinstated) and on time performance. long may this improvement last!",0.9961,Positive

1157," a very acceptable flight. this was a night flight new york jfk to london, so it was difficult to assess the service onboard, although what i experienced was certainly not bad. i think this was a very quiet flight, judging from the number of people around the gate, and there were only another 4-5 pax in first. but it's quite hard to tell when wrapped in the cocoons of the concorde room and first cabin. the former felt very exclusive but, as commented elsewhere, to the point of being fussy. it's irritating that they don't have any showers in the concorde room; i wasn't amused to check in at the galleries (business) lounge, be brusquely sent on to concorde, only to have to return to galeries upon learning that that were no showers in the former (it was 7pm, early august in nyc - of course i needed a shower!). departures from ny were running around 3 hours late that evening due to weather, and we were warned about a 60 min taxi to the runway. but we were very well looked after at that point; the cabin wasn't secured until just before takeoff, and the boredom of the taxi was eased by multiple - and very welcome - top-ups of champagne, seved by various members of the crew. likewise, all the perks of first class were there; i was addressed by name, the crew introduced themselves individually, dinner and drinks orders were taken, etc. all very courteous and professional. after such a long delay, i decided to have some more dinner as i was quite peckish; this came with some excellent wine, and was served promptly, so there was still plenty of time for sleep. but the soup was cold, and the main wouldn't have been out of place in business class. moreover, it would have been nice if someone had mentioned that the ba arrivals lounge at lhr would be closing by the time our delayed flight reached its destination; had i known this, i would have had breakfast and a freshen up on the plane. a very annoying oversight that led to quite a lot of inconvenience (picture a spoilt guy trying to insert contact lenses in t5 arrivals toilets...perhaps you saw me?). the cabin layout and bed: well, it's easy to find details of this elsewhere online. but it's certainly nothing special for first class. overall, a very acceptable flight, but i felt that the overly-fussy service sometimes got in the way of the practicalities of a short overnight atlantic crossing (where can i have a shower in the morning? where will i be having breakfast?). i've had business class flights from other carriers that have absolutely nailed these aspects.",0.9104,Positive

1293,"crew very friendly and professional. london to muscat first class. first time trying out first class on ba. check-in was fairly quick and efficient, didn't have much luggage, but the first wing did not feel very exclusive. i had selected window seat in advance and this was confirmed and still intact as i got printed boarding pass. concorde room was nice, well designed but quite crowded in some places. had to ask for a champagne two times out in the terrace, before it got served a good 20 minutes later. checkout out the cabana for an hour, which was not very appealing at all, and managed to miss the first 5 min of the 15min treatment i booked for the spa. onboard was informed there was a problem with the seat i had selected, and was issued a new aisle seat, which was disappointing. upon entering the first class cabin, i had a quick look at the seat, and it was not immediately apparent, there was something wrong. i asked a crew to check and they came back to confirm that i will indeed not be able to sit there, but there was no explanation of what was wrong given. i did not want to waste any time to settle in, the crew looking after me introduced himself and served me champagne and warm nuts as well as offering some magazines to read. seat was comfortable and spacious enough and seemed fairly private, with a small wardrobe to hang jacket. the tv screen seemed quite large and high quality. unfortunately the seat controls were not super responsive, and neither was the remote for the tv. soon after take off, i was informed i could eat when i like. arabic starter was great. had pre-selected main meal online. meal was of good quality and cooked well. had a dessert and the mixed cheese plate (not as good as other cheese i've had in some business class). surprisingly the entertainment system had a rather limited selection, i imagine on two ultra-long flights in the same month, one might run out of anything of interest to watch. after finishing the one film i decided to watch, i decided to try get some sleep. crew made the bedding while i tried to put on the pyjamas in the tiny first class bathroom. bedding was of good quality and comfortable enough. i missed breakfast, as i was still rather full from the dinner and pre-dinner at the lounge. overall, i was reasonably happy with the flight and the product. the crew were very friendly and professional. given this was first class, have to admit there was no wow factor, either with the soft product or ground experience. i managed to book flights for a good price during a promo, otherwise it would personally not be worth the price tag for a fairly short flight.",0.9863,Positive
1294,"entertainment was not working. my family and i travelled from cape town to london on the 10th march 2018. we have a 1 year old and a 4 year old. once seated, we realised that our entertainment system was not working. the cabin light for all seats that we had booked were not working either. there was minimal effort from the cabin team to try and resolve this. as it was a night flight, my wife and i had to see to our 1 year old in the dark. any help we needed required us to walk to the galley to receive any assistance. as bas safety demonstration prior to take off is on video, we didn't receive this. the flight was the worst airline experience we've had. i doubt i'll ever fly with ba again.",0.5719,Positive
1295,"staff try so very hard to please. gatwick to madeira. the flight left on time and arrived early, slept as early morning flight. the plane was not very clean, grubby tray between seats and ingrained dirt in the spokes of the seats. the staff were pleasant. breakfast was offered and my children felt it was adequate. the return was poorly organised, no use of fast track security for business class passengers. long queue for boarding and a grubby plane. really no point in paying for business class. the staff try so very hard to please the passengers but nearly 4 hours and no entertainment, dog-eared magazines.  quickly disembarked and swiftly through immigration.",-0.0991,Neutral
1296,"extremely unprofessional. london to casablanca. their customer service quality in heathrow terminal 3 is very patchy. for background, my initial flight was with tap portugal which got cancelled, then rebooked to ba. my second flight had further issue, and instead of requesting tap to rebook me, ba took the liberty of rebooking a 3rd flight for me - which turned out to be overbooked. this then caused me having to liaise with both tap and ba to rebook my 4th flight - i was tossed around by both customer care telling me it's not their problem. tap can no longer rebook me on another flight as they have lost the right to alter the ticket as soon as ba rebooked me on the 3rd flight. i was initially served by a very helpful staff who attends to my rebooking issue - the last flight i was rebooked was overbooked. however, later on i was passed on to a couple of rude staff that were reluctant to serve me as it was 15 minutes past their end of shift. they were also talking about me in front of me and accused me of taking advantage of ba. this is very rude and extremely unprofessional. i've never had this treatment during my 10+ years of flying with various airlines, both top rated and low cost carrier.",-0.7127,Negative
1297,"manager is very professional. british airways flight manager is very professional. i travelled on ba985 from berlin to hong kong via london on 19 feb. due to the snowy weather, my flight leaving berlin to london was delayed, in which i was worried about missing my connecting flight from london to hong kong. during the flight, the manager came to me several times, explained to me the reason of flight delay, informed me about the connecting flight arrangements. her information was very clear, trusted she has been working closely with airport ground on this. very much appreciated for their service.",0.5023,Positive
1298,regret choosing ba. hyderabad to brussels via london. didn't expect this from british airways. for me quality hit the rock bottom. especially the unclean flight. i would have preferred the aircraft from brussels to london and vice versa for the long haul travel. maybe my expectations was too high but considering the price i paid for ticket i think it's not worth it. other airline which i used to travel had the same price and if i compare the services of that ariline i regret choosing british airways.,-0.6907,Negative
1299,"an entirely reasonable flight. london gatwick to fort lauderdale is one of ba's new long-haul routes and clearly designed to cater for winter sun seekers. from september 2018, the gatwick fleet will be 'densified', with an horrific ten across in economy and a reduced club world. the 777-200 on our flight was of the bog-standard 90s vintage, which meant 48 pax squeezed into the club world cabin and everyone having to make do with the ancient, small screen, low resolution ife that required the usual rebooting. but there were positive aspects to the flight: a young and efficient cabin crew, the improved club world food service with plates brought individually to one's seat, and arrival ahead of schedule, although this was let down by the delayed disembarkation that's commonplace at fort lauderdale terminal 4. overall, an entirely reasonable flight.",0.875,Positive
